# dimensions-educational-research-foundation-theme
This theme was designed and built for Dimensions Educational Research Foundation. 


## History
Designed by Stacy Hadley (Nature Explore) in 2011, this theme was ment to provide a similar structure between each of the divisions of Dimensions, while giving each site its own look. The orginal concept was built by Ross Brown (Arbor Day) using ColdFusion. In 2016, the concept was re-built in WordPress by Michael Kracke (Nature Explore).
