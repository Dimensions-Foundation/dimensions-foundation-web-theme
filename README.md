Dimensions Educational Research Foundation Web Theme for WordPress

# History
This theme was originally designed by Stacy Hadley (Dimensions Foundation: Graphic Designer) and built in 2012 using ColdFusion by Ross Brown (Arbor Day: Graphic Designer). The purpose of this design was to have a similar structure between NatureExplore.org, DimenisonsFoundation.org, and DimensionsFoundation.org, while allowing each site to retain their own unique style.

In 2016 Michael Kracke (Dimensions Foundation: Web Developer), rebuilt the theme in Wordpress. This was the first step in moving all of the sites managed by Dimensions Foundation into WordPress to allow for a broader range of users to edit web content and to fix the issues that occurred when in a mobile format.

# Structure
This theme is built to be used for DimensionsFoundation.org, DimensionEd.org, and NatureExplore.org simultaneously. Due to this certain aspects of this theme are ambiguous to allow for customization on the front end, while other aspects require specific templates and php functions that are applied beside on site (determined by URL).
